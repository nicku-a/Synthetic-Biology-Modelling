## Mathematical modelling of biological AND gate
This repository contains Python and Matlab scripts used to model a biological AND gate, replicate the results found by Wang B. et al (2011)[1], and visualise experimental data collected as part of a third year group project at Imperial College London. 
Modelling the system mathematically allowed us to predict behaviour and make changes during wet labs.
