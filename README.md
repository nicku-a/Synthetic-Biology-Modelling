## Mathematical modelling of biological AND gate for third year group project
This code was used to model a biological AND gate. When the concentrations of two input inducers are high, the output of the gate (gene transcription) is high.
Modelling the system mathematically allowed us to predict behaviour and make changes during wet labs.
